Scheduling system based on devExtreme's Scheduler library. Not for commercial use.

This was built as part of contract work from a small company in Grand Rapids. The next steps are connecting it to their database and billing systems. The appointments are fake and there is no identifying information. This is also not connected to any database and any changes will only be saved to local storage. This is meant to be an example that I have experience with learning and utilizing open source libraries.

Any questions and concerns? Job offers?
